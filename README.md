## View point

The invasion of Ukraine by Russia has multiple collateral damages. Most noticed is on the economic ground with the energy ban and subsequent inflation. But as the Paris Summer Olympics are getting closer, the conflict is becoming increasingly present on the sports front. 

## The Analysis

With recent decisions from the Olympic Committee to accept Russian and Belarus athletes under certain conditions, the topic has hit the press titles.
We include in the analysis articles from the French sport newspaper Lâ€™Equipe, the Italian public broadcaster RAI News, a Spanish sport title Estadio Deportivo. To have a different view point, we included the English edition of the Russian Pravda newspaper. All articles were published between December 8th and December 19th 2023.
