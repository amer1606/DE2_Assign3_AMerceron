## View point

The invasion of Ukraine by Russia has multiple collateral damages. Most noticed is on the economic ground with the energy ban and subsequent inflation. But as the Paris Summer Olympics are getting closer, the conflict is becoming increasingly present on the sports front. 

## The Analysis

With recent decisions from the Olympic Committee to accept Russian and Belarus athletes under certain conditions, the topic has hit the press titles.
We include in the analysis articles from the French sport newspaper L’Equipe, the Italian public broadcaster RAI News, a Spanish sport title Estadio Deportivo. To have a different view point, we included the English edition of the Russian Pravda newspaper. All articles were published between December 8th and December 19th 2023.

## Tools

We used two AWS services: the first one, Translate, to get an English version of the articles; the second one, Comprehend, to have a selection of key words and the “sentiment” coming out of these articles.

## Findings

Content
Whilst the French and the Spanish media refer specifically to the war, the Italian media do not as the article is focused on the more opened position of Sebastian Coe, president of World Athletics. As expected, no mention is made on the war, neither on the special operation, on the Russian media.

Sentiment
More revealing is the sentiment analysis, from AWS Comprehend, which illustrates the neutrality in all three western media, as opposed to the negative sentiment expressed in the Russian Pravda (English edition).
